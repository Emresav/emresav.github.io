## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="emre.jpg">

Hello. I am working as a Research Associate in the [Department of Informatics](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/informatics/index.aspx) at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk). My ongoing project is the European Robotic Goal-Oriented [ERGO](http://h2020-ergo.gmv.com/author/ergo/) Autonomous Controller Project. I actively work on the development of an AI planning software, called **Stellar**, to be run on-board autonomous spacecraft that will be launched by the *European Space Agency (ESA)*. I also manage the integration tests of Stellar with the rest of robotic components on simulation and physical environments. 

## Research Interest

I am particularly interested in AI planning applications in the fields of robotic and manufacturing in temporal and numeric settings. I have successfully defended my thesis, **Temporal-Numeric Planning with Control Parameters** on June 2018. During my PhD studies, I have extended a standardised planning language, [**PDDL**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language), to reason about flexible numeric parameters (we called them *Control Parameters*) that can take their values from considerably large-sized domains. I have developed an AI planning software, called **POPCORN**, that can reason about these parameters. My motivation on this work was to model and encapsulate controllable dynamics of the real-world environment in AI planning frameworks. I successfully applied this planning paradigm as a case study on a Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) application as a part of the EU-Funded [SQUIRREL](http://www.squirrel-project.eu/) Project.

## Softwares
You can find the source code of the POPCORN planner and the MILP compilation work that I collaborated with Chiara Piacentini [on my GitHub repository](https://github.com/Emresav/popcorn). You can also access the Scala and Java template codes that I commonly use on [here](https://github.com/Emresav/).
